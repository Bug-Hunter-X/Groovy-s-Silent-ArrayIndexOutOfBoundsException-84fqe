This repository demonstrates a subtle difference between Groovy and Java's array handling. In Java, accessing an element outside the array bounds throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException. Groovy, however, handles this differently, leading to a `groovy.lang.MissingMethodException` which might be unexpected. The example showcases this behavior and provides a solution for robust error handling.
